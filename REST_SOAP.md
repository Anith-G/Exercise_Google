# Overview of REST and SOAP Web Services
Web services facilitate communication between distributed systems over the internet. The two primary approaches are REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). Each has distinct characteristics and is suited for different use cases.

# REST Web Services
REST is an architectural style that leverages standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for resource manipulation. It typically utilizes lightweight data formats such as JSON and XML, enabling high scalability and efficiency. RESTful services are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all necessary information, eliminating the need for session management on the server.

# Key Characteristics of REST:

1. Adheres to a client-server architecture with stateless interactions.
1. Uses standard HTTP methods and URIs for resource identification.
1. Supports multiple data formats, including JSON and XML.
1. Provides high scalability, making it suitable for web, mobile, and IoT applications.

# SOAP Web Services
SOAP is a protocol that relies on XML-based messaging for structured data exchange. It supports multiple transport protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and TCP, and follows strict specifications for message formatting and security. SOAP services are commonly used in enterprise environments where reliability, transactional integrity, and compliance with WS- standards* (e.g., WS-Security, WS-ReliableMessaging) are critical.

# Key Characteristics of SOAP:
Uses XML-based messaging and follows a strict message structure.
Supports multiple transport protocols beyond HTTP.
Provides built-in security and reliability mechanisms.
Well-suited for applications requiring ACID-compliant transactions and enterprise-level security.
